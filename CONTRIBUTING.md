### Multilanguage Support

The ccxt library is available in three different languages (more to come). One of the primary objectives for developers is to design *portable* code, so that a single-language user can read code in other languages and understand it easily. This helps the adoption of the library. The main goal is to provide a generalized, unified, consistent and robust interface to as many existing cryptocurrency exchanges as possible.

At first, all language-specific version were developed in parallel, but separately from each other. But when it became too hard to maintain and keep the code consistent among all supported languages we decided to switch to what we call a *master/slave* process. There is now a single master version in one language, that is JavaScript. Other language-specific versions are syntactically derived (transpiled, generated) from the master version. But it doesn't mean that you have to be a JS coder to contribute. The portability principle allows Python and PHP devs to effectively participate in developing the master version as well.

### Continuous Integration

Builds are automated by [travis-ci]. Code coverage is analyzed with [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io). All build steps are described in the [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/.travis.yml) file. A build consists of the following:

1. Install dependencies
2. Increment version number _(not triggered by pull requests)_
3. Transpile JavaScript → Python/PHP and wiki documentation from the master source file
4. Run tests and collect code coverage analytics
5. Send coverage report to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io)
6. Push built files back to GitHub _(not triggered by pull requests)_
7. Push generated wiki documentation files back to a separate GitHub repo _(not triggered by pull requests)_

You can also execute build steps manually to make sure everything works before committing your changes.

#### Install Dependencies

You will need the latest version of `pandoc` supporting `--wrap=preserve` option. On OSX it can be installed easily with `brew install pandoc` (you will need [brew](https://brew.sh/) as well). For other options see [Installing pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).

#### Increment Version Number

The version number is single-sourced from the main NPM package file `package.json` to JavaScript, Python and PHP. It gets incremented by the standard `npm version patch` command upon each release and then the updated version number is injected into all source files.

#### Transpile Sources And Documentation

Everything is done by the `npm run build` command. The transpilation is performed by a custom utility script in the root of the repository, named `transpile.js` that derives slave versions in other languages from the master code. The script converts language syntax from JS to Python/PHP and it is itself written in JavaScript. The transpiler does its job by sequentially applying series of regexp substitutions to perform one-to-one (line-to-line) mapping from JS to other languages.

Read [Master/Slave Code](https://github.com/kroitor/ccxt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#masterslave-code) below for more details before hacking the actual source code.

#### Run Tests And Collect Coverage

Run the standard `npm test` command to see test results and code coverage analytics. The coverage analysis is also available in HTML (see the generated `coverage` folder). A transpilation is triggered automatically by the `npm test` command, so there is no need to execute the `npm run build` manually before.

To speed up test execution you can use the `npm run fasttest` command. It will only test the master `ccxt.js` file, and thus does not require the `npm run build` to be executed first. You can also pass a market name and an symbol (optional), to test a part of code or a single market. A partial test is usually many times faster than the full test:

```bash
npm test                         # runs the full test
npm test kraken                  # runs a partial test for Kraken
npm test kraken BTC/USD          # partial test for BTC/USD @ Kraken
npm run fasttest                 # full test of master source file only
npm run fasttest gdax            # partial test of master source file only for GDAX
npm run fasttest gdax BTC/USD    # partial test only for the BTC/USD pair on GDAX exchange
```

Other languages can also be tested by running the following scripts (`npm run build` is required in prior):

```bash
python test.py
python test.py kraken
python test.py kraken BTC/USD
php -f test.php
php -f test.php gdax
php -f test.php gdax BTC/USD
```

## Master/Slave Code

The ccxt library includes one single file per each language:

```shell
/ccxt/__init__.py  # slave Python-version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.es5.js       # slave JavaScript ES5 version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.js           # master JS ES6 version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.php          # slave PHP version of the ccxt library
```

Slave files and docs are partially-generated from the master `ccxt.js` file by the `npm run build` command.

The structure of the master/slave file can be outlined like this:

```
      +--------------------------+ ← beginning of file
h  /  |                          |
e  |  |  common stuff            |
a  |  |                          |  
d <   //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler comment is used to separate code blocks 
e  |  |                          |
r  |  |  base market class       |   above this first bold line all code is language-specific
   \  |                          |                    ↑
      //=========================+ ← first 'bold' horizontal ruler comment
   /  |                          |                    ↓
   |  |  derived market class A  |   below this line all code can be ported to other languages
   |  |                          |
b  |  //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler used to separate derived classes
o  |  |                          |
d <   |  derived market class B  |
y  |  |                          |
   |  //-------------------------+
   |  |                          |
   |  | ...                      |   above this line all code is transpileable
   \  |                          |                    ↑
      //=========================+ ← second 'bold' horizontal ruler comment
f  /  |                          |                    ↓
o  |  |  other code              |   below this second bold line all code is language-specific
o  |  |                          |
t <   //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler comment is used to separate code blocks 
e  |  |                          |   
r  |  |  other code              |   
   \  |                          |
      //-------------------------+ ← end of file
```

Key notes on the structure of the library file:

- thin ruler comments are there for code block separation
- bold ruler comments are there to separate language-specific base code from language-agnostic derived implementations
- bold rulers are marker hints for the transpiler to quickly find the code for conversion
- the second bold ruler and footer are optional
- ...

### Derived Market Classes

Below are key notes on how to keep the JS code transpileable:

- do not use language-specific code syntax sugar, even if you really want to
- unfold all maps and comprehensions to basic for-loops
- always use Python-style indentation, it is preserved as is for all languages
- always put a semicolon (`;`) at the end of each statement, as in PHP/C-style=
- all associative keys must be single-quoted strings everywhere (`array['good'], array.bad`)
- all local variables should be declared with `let` keyword
- do everything with base class methods only
- if you need another base method you will have to implement it in the base class in all three languages
- try to reduce syntax to basic one-liner statements
- multiple lines are ok, but you should avoid deep nesting with lots of brackets
- do not use conditional statements that are too complex
- ...

**If you want to add (support for) another market or implement a new method for a particular exchange, then the best way to make it a consistent improvement is to learn by example, take a look at how same things are implemented in other markets and try to copy the code flow and style.**

The basic JSON-skeleton for a new market integration is as follows:

```JSON
{
   "id": "example",
   "name": "Example Exchange",
   "country": [ "US", "EU", "CN", "RU" ],
   "rateLimit": 1000,
   "version": "1",
   "comment": "This comment is optional",
   "urls": {
      "logo": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
      "api": "https://api.example.com/api",
      "www": "https://www.example.com",
      "doc": [
         "https://www.example.com/docs/api",
         "https://www.example.com/docs/howto",
         "https://github.com/example/docs"
      ]
   },
   "api": {
      "public": {
         "get": [
            "endpoint/example",
            "orderbook/{pair}/full",
            "{pair}/ticker"
         ]
      },
      "private": {
         "post": [
            "balance"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```
