## Install

The easiest way to install the ccxt library is to use builtin package managers:

- [ccxt in **NPM**](http://npmjs.com/package/ccxt) (JavaScript / Node v7.6+)
- [ccxt in **PyPI**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt) (Python 3)

This library is shipped as an all-in-one module implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements:

- [ccxt.js](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/ccxt.js) in JavaScript
- [./python/](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/python/) in Python (generated from JS)
- [ccxt.php](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/ccxt.php) in PHP (generated from JS)

You can also clone it into your project directory from [ccxt GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) and copy files
manually into your working directory with language extension appropriate for your environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git
```

An alternative way of installing this library is to build a custom bundle from source. Choose exchanges you need in `exchanges.cfg`.

### JavaScript (NPM)

JavaScript version of ccxt works both in Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and `async/await` syntax support (Node 10.4.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is [not excluded](https://github.com/ccxt-dev/ccxt/issues/225#issuecomment-331582275) in your `babel-loader` config.

[ccxt crypto trading library in npm](http://npmjs.com/package/ccxt)

```shell
npm install ccxt
```

```JavaScript
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')

console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
```

### JavaScript (for use with the `<script>` tag):

All-in-one browser bundle (dependencies included), served from a CDN of your choice:

* jsDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@1.65.12/dist/ccxt.browser.js
* unpkg: https://unpkg.com/ccxt@1.65.12/dist/ccxt.browser.js

You can obtain a live-updated version of the bundle by removing the version number from the URL (the `@a.b.c` thing) — however, we do not recommend to do that, as it may break your app eventually. Also, please keep in mind that we are not responsible for the correct operation of those CDN servers.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@1.65.12/dist/ccxt.browser.js"></script>
```

Creates a global `ccxt` object:

```JavaScript
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
```

### Custom JavaScript Builds

It takes time to load all scripts and resources. The problem with in-browser usage is that the entire CCXT library weighs a few megabytes which is a lot for a web application. Sometimes it is also critical for a Node app. Therefore to lower the loading time you might want to make your own custom build of CCXT for your app with just the exchanges you need.

Follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git

# 2. go to the cloned repository

cd ccxt

# 3. install dependencies

npm install

# 4. edit exchanges.cfg for the exchanges of your interest

echo "binance\nftx" > exchanges.cfg

# 5. build the library

npm run build

# 6a. copy the browser file to your project folder if you are buildig a web application

cp build/ccxt.browser.js path/to/your/html/project

# 6b. or link against the library if you are building a Node.js application
npm link
cd path/to/your/node/project
npm link ccxt
```

### Python

[ccxt algotrading library in PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt)

```shell
pip install ccxt
```

```Python
import ccxt
print(ccxt.exchanges) # print a list of all available exchange classes
```

The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.5.3+

```Python
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt # link against the asynchronous version of ccxt
```

### PHP

The autoloadable version of ccxt can be installed with [**Packagist/Composer**](https://packagist.org/packages/ccxt/ccxt) (PHP 5.4+).

It can also be installed from the source code: [**`ccxt.php`**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccxt/ccxt/master/php)

It requires common PHP modules:

- cURL
- mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
- PCRE
- iconv
- gmp (this is a built-in extension as of PHP 7.2+)

```PHP
include "ccxt.php";
var_dump (\ccxt\Exchange::$exchanges); // print a list of all available exchange classes
```

The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode using tools from [RecoilPHP](https://github.com/recoilphp/recoil) and [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/) in PHP 7.2+. Read the [Manual](https://docs.ccxt.com) for more details.

### Docker

You can get CCXT installed in a container along with all the supported languages and dependencies. This may be useful if you want to contribute to CCXT (e.g. run the build scripts and tests — please see the [Contributing](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for the details on that).

You don't need the Docker image if you're not going to develop CCXT. If you just want to use CCXT – just install it as a regular package into your project.

Using `docker-compose` (in the cloned CCXT repository):

```shell
docker-compose run --rm ccxt
```

Alternatively:

```shell
docker build . --tag ccxt
docker run -it ccxt
```

## Proxy

In some specific cases you may want a proxy, if you experience issues with [DDoS protection by Cloudflare](https://docs.ccxt.com/en/latest/manual.html#ddos-protection-by-cloudflare-incapsula) or your network / country / IP is rejected by their filters.

**Bear in mind that each added intermediary contributes to the overall latency and roundtrip time. Longer delays can result in price slippage.**

### JavaScript Proxies

In order to use proxies with JavaScript, one needs to pass the proxying `agent` option to the exchange class instance constructor (or set the `exchange.agent` property later after instantiation in runtime):

```JavaScript
const ccxt = require ('ccxt')
    , HttpsProxyAgent = require ('https-proxy-agent')

const proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128' // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
const agent = new HttpsProxyAgent (proxy)

const kraken = new ccxt.kraken ({ agent })
```

### Python Proxies

The python version of the library uses the [python-requests](python-requests.org) package for underlying HTTP and supports all means of customization available in the `requests` package, including proxies.

You can configure proxies by setting the environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.

```shell
$ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
$ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
```

After exporting the above variables with your proxy settings, all reqeusts from within ccxt will be routed through those proxies.

You can also set them programmatically:

```Python
import ccxt
exchange = ccxt.poloniex({
    'proxies': {
        'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',  # these proxies won't work for you, they are here for example
        'https': 'https://10.10.1.10:1080',
    },
})
```

Or

```Python
import ccxt
exchange = ccxt.poloniex()
exchange.proxies = {
  'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128', # these proxies won't work for you, they are here for example
  'https': 'https://10.10.1.10:1080',
}
```

#### Python 3 sync proxies

- https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/examples/py/proxy-sync-python-requests-2-and-3.py

```Python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import os
import sys
import ccxt
from pprint import pprint


exchange = ccxt.poloniex({
    #
    # ↓ The "proxy" property setting below is for CORS-proxying only!
    # Do not use it if you don't know what a CORS proxy is.
    # https://docs.ccxt.com/en/latest/install.html#cors-access-control-allow-origin
    # You should only use the "proxy" setting if you're having a problem with Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    # In Python you rarely need to use it, if ever at all.
    #
    # 'proxy': 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/',
    #
    # ↓ On the other hand, the "proxies" setting is for HTTP(S)-proxying (SOCKS, etc...)
    # It is a standard method of sending your requests through your proxies
    # This gets passed to the `python-requests` implementation directly
    # You can also enable this with environment variables, as described here:
    # http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies
    # This is the setting you should be using with synchronous version of ccxt in Python 3
    #
    'proxies': {
        'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
        'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
    },
})

# your code goes here...

pprint(exchange.fetch_ticker('ETH/BTC'))
```

#### Python 3.5+ asyncio/aiohttp proxy

- https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/examples/py/proxy-asyncio-aiohttp-python-3.py

```Python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import asyncio
import os
import sys
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt
from pprint import pprint


async def test_gdax():

    exchange = ccxt.poloniex({
        #
        # ↓ The "proxy" property setting below is for CORS-proxying only!

        # It is a standard method of sending your requests through your proxies
        # This gets passed to the `asyncio` and `aiohttp` implementation directly
        # You can use this setting as documented here:
        # https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html#proxy-support
        # This is the setting you should be using with async version of ccxt in Python 3.5+
        #
        'aiohttp_proxy': 'http://proxy.com',
        # 'aiohttp_proxy': 'http://user:pass@some.proxy.com',
        # 'aiohttp_proxy': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
    })

    # your code goes here...

    ticker = await exchange.fetch_ticker('ETH/BTC')

    # don't forget to free the used resources, when you don't need them anymore
    await exchange.close()

    return ticker

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pprint(asyncio.run(test_gdax()))
```

A more detailed documentation on using proxies with the sync python version of the ccxt library can be found here:

- [Proxies](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies)
- [SOCKS](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#socks)

#### Python aiohttp SOCKS proxy

```
pip install aiohttp_socks
```

```Python
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt
import aiohttp
import aiohttp_socks

async def test():

    connector = aiohttp_socks.ProxyConnector.from_url('socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080')
    session = aiohttp.ClientSession(connector=connector)

    exchange = ccxt.binance({
        'session': session,
        'enableRateLimit': True,
        # ...
    })

    # ...

    await session.close()  # don't forget to close the session

    # ...
```

## CORS (Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

If you need a CORS proxy, use the `proxy` property (a string literal) containing base URL of http(s) proxy. It is for use with web browsers and from blocked locations.

CORS is [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). When accessing the HTTP REST API of an exchange from browser with ccxt library you may get a warning or an exception, saying `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource`. That means that the exchange admins haven't enabled access to their API from arbitrary web browser pages.

You can still use the ccxt library from your browser via a CORS-proxy, which is very easy to set up or install. There are also public CORS proxies on the internet.

The absolute exchange endpoint URL is appended to `proxy` string before HTTP request is sent to exchange. The `proxy` setting is an empty string `''` by default. Below are examples of a non-empty `proxy` string (last slash is mandatory!):

- `kraken.proxy = 'https://crossorigin.me/'`
- `gdax.proxy   = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/'`

To run your own CORS proxy locally you can either set up one of the existing ones or make a quick script of your own, like shown below.

### Node.js CORS Proxy

```JavaScript
// JavaScript CORS Proxy
// Save this in a file like cors.js and run with `node cors [port]`
// It will listen for your requests on the port you pass in command line or port 8080 by default
let port = (process.argv.length > 2) ? parseInt (process.argv[2]) : 8080; // default
require ('cors-anywhere').createServer ().listen (port, 'localhost')
```

### Python CORS Proxy

```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# Python CORS Proxy
# Save this in a file like cors.py and run with `python cors.py [port]` or `cors [port]`
try:
    # Python 3
    from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler, test as test_orig
    import sys
    def test (*args):
        test_orig (*args, port = int (sys.argv[1]) if len (sys.argv) > 1 else 8080)
except ImportError: # Python 2
    from BaseHTTPServer import HTTPServer, test
    from SimpleHTTPServer import SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

class CORSRequestHandler (SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def end_headers (self):
        self.send_header ('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.end_headers (self)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    test (CORSRequestHandler, HTTPServer)
```

### Testing CORS

After you set it up and run it, you can test it by querying the target URL of exchange endpoint through the proxy (like https://localhost:8080/https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint).

To test the CORS you can do either of the following:

- set up proxy somewhere in your browser settings, then go to endpoint URL `https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint`
- type that URL directly in the address bar as `https://localhost:8080/https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint`
- cURL it from command like `curl https://localhost:8080/https://exchange.com/path/to/endpoint`

To let ccxt know of the proxy, you can set the `proxy` property on your exchange instance.
